Question 03
Create a program to validate an email address based on a few basic criteria. The program will
prompt the user to enter an email address and will dynamically allocate memory to store and
process the input.
Define the following function:
1. int validateEmail(char* email): This function validates the email based on the following
criteria:
○ Contains exactly one @ symbol.
○ Contains at least one dot (.) after the @ symbol.
○ Is non-empty.
○ Returns 1 if the email is valid, and 0 if invalid.

Steps:
1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter an email address. Allocate memory dynamically for the
email, ensuring the memory size is based on the input length.
2. Validation Process:
○ Call the validateEmail function to check if the email meets the criteria.
3. Display Results:
○ Print "Valid Email" if the email meets the criteria.
○ Print "Invalid Email" if the email does not meet the criteria.
4. Memory Cleanup:
○ Free the dynamically allocated memory after validation to prevent memory leaks.
