You are tasked with creating a program that generates a histogram based on user input. The user will
provide a set of values, and your program will use loops to create a visual representation of these values.
1. Input Handling: Write a function that takes an array of integers (the values) and the count of
those integers as input.
2. Horizontal Histogram Function: Use loops to generate and print a histogram, where each
value is represented by asterisks (*).
3. Vertical Histogram Function: Use loops to generate and print a vrtical histogram, where
each value is represented by asterisks (*).
Expected Values:
int values [] = {3, 5, 1, 4};
int count = 4;
Horizontal Histogram
Value 1: ***
Value 2: *****
Value 3: *
Value 4: ****
Vertical Histogram
